# Zap YML Injector
- ⚠️ Environment Variable `API_KEY` must be set before running. This is used to authorise requests to the server.
- Optionally, the variable `FILE_PATH` can be set to determine the location/name of the YML file. By default this is `./output.yml`.

To start the server, run `npm start`.
